# ðŸ“¦ Complete Stock Management System

## âœ… **Automatic Stock Deduction Implemented**

I've implemented a complete stock management system that automatically reduces product stock when orders are placed.

### ðŸ”§ **How Stock Management Works**

#### **1. Automatic Stock Deduction**
- âœ… **When orders are created** - Stock is automatically reduced
- âœ… **Real-time updates** - Stock levels update immediately
- âœ… **Prevents overselling** - Can't order more than available stock
- âœ… **Stock validation** - Alerts when trying to order more than available

#### **2. Stock Validation Features**
- âœ… **Order creation validation** - Checks stock before allowing orders
- âœ… **Quantity update validation** - Prevents increasing quantity beyond stock
- âœ… **User-friendly alerts** - Clear messages about stock availability
- âœ… **Real-time stock display** - Shows current stock levels

### ðŸŽ¯ **New Functions Added**

#### **1. `updateProductStock()` Function**
```typescript
// Automatically reduces stock when orders are created
updateProductStock: (orderItems: Array<{
  product_id: string;
  quantity: number;
}>): void => {
  // Reduces stock quantity for each ordered item
  // Updates product timestamps
  // Saves updated products to localStorage
}
```

#### **2. `recalculateProductStock()` Function**
```typescript
// Recalculates stock levels from all orders
recalculateProductStock: (): void => {
  // Analyzes all orders to determine stock usage
  // Provides stock reporting
  // Helps with inventory management
}
```

### ðŸš€ **Stock Management Features**

#### **1. Automatic Stock Reduction**
- **When**: Every time an order is created
- **What**: Stock quantity is reduced by ordered quantity
- **Result**: Real-time inventory tracking

#### **2. Stock Validation**
- **Prevents overselling** - Can't order more than available
- **User alerts** - Clear messages about stock limits
- **Real-time checks** - Validates on every quantity change

#### **3. Stock Monitoring**
- **Real-time display** - Current stock shown in product cards
- **Low stock alerts** - Dashboard shows products with low stock
- **Stock reporting** - Recalculate button for inventory analysis

### ðŸŽ¯ **How It Works in Practice**

#### **Step 1: Create Products**
1. Add products with initial stock quantities
2. Set stock levels (e.g., 100 units)
3. Products appear with current stock displayed

#### **Step 2: Create Orders**
1. Select products for order
2. System validates stock availability
3. If insufficient stock â†’ Alert shown
4. If sufficient stock â†’ Order created
5. **Stock automatically reduced** âœ…

#### **Step 3: Stock Updates**
1. Product stock levels update immediately
2. Dashboard shows low stock alerts
3. Products with 0 stock are clearly marked

### ðŸ”§ **Stock Management Tools**

#### **1. Recalculate Stock Button**
- **Location**: Products page header
- **Purpose**: Analyze stock usage from all orders
- **Use**: When you need to review inventory

#### **2. Stock Validation**
- **Add to Order**: Checks stock before adding
- **Update Quantity**: Validates stock before increasing
- **Order Creation**: Final validation before saving

#### **3. Low Stock Alerts**
